------Railway Reservation System------
    The Railway Reservation System is a purely console-based Java application designed to strengthen Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It allows users to book, cancel, and manage train reservations efficiently using optimized data structures without any database or graphical interface.

    --------OOPS and DSa----
      OOP Principles

Encapsulation - Used to protect data and restrict direct access.

Abstraction - Implemented through abstract classes/interfaces.

Inheritance - Used for structuring different user roles.

Polymorphism - Method overriding and overloading for flexibility.

DSA Implementation

Queues (LinkedList) - Managing RAC and Waiting List.

Lists (ArrayList) - Storing available and booked seats.

HashMap - Mapping passenger details.

Greedy Algorithm - Optimized berth allocation.
